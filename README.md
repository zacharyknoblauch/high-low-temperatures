The program prompts the user to input temperature values for as many days as the user wants.
As the user inputs data, the program will determing whether the input high is higher than the previously recorded highest high. 
If the input high is higher than the recorded highest high, it will change the highest high value to the input value to reflect that.
The program will do the same respectively for the lowest low and input lows.

To exit the program, input the value -100 for either a high or low.
The program will then output the highest high value and the lowest low value to the monitor.
